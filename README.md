# Moments-of-SP500
Descriptive statistics of SP500 firms

For each component of SP500 I have computed the historical mean, variance, skewness and kurtosis also plotting the correlation between those moments and the correlation between each stock return and the SP500 return. I have finally tested for stability over time for the period pre-2020 and post-2020 using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test
